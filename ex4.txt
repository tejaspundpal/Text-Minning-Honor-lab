Write a Python program to classify document in specified category


from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.svm import SVC

# Training data
documents = [
    ("This is an example document about sports.", "sports"),
    ("The new movie is releasing this weekend.", "entertainment"),
    ("I love trying new recipes in the kitchen.", "food"),
    ("The stock market is experiencing a downturn.", "finance")
]

# Create the training dataset
train_texts, train_labels = zip(*documents)

# Vectorize the training texts
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
train_features = vectorizer.fit_transform(train_texts)

# Train the SVM classifier
classifier = SVC(kernel='linear')
classifier.fit(train_features, train_labels)

# Test document to classify
test_text = "I enjoy playing football on weekends."

# Vectorize the test text
test_features = vectorizer.transform([test_text])

# Predict the category of the test document
try:
    predicted_label = classifier.predict(test_features)[0]
    print("Predicted Category:", predicted_label)
except IndexError:
    print("Unable to classify the document into any category.")




output:-


Predicted Category: sports
