Write a Python program to discover abstract "topics" that occur in a collection of documents.



from gensim import corpora
from gensim.models import LdaModel
from gensim.parsing.preprocessing import preprocess_string

# Sample collection of documents
documents = [
    "The sun is shining in the sky.",
    "The weather is beautiful today.",
    "I enjoy going for a walk in the park.",
    "I love to watch birds flying in the sky.",
    "Rainy days make me feel cozy at home."
]

# Preprocess documents
preprocessed_docs = [preprocess_string(doc) for doc in documents]

# Create a dictionary from preprocessed documents
dictionary = corpora.Dictionary(preprocessed_docs)

# Create a bag-of-words representation for each document
bow_corpus = [dictionary.doc2bow(doc) for doc in preprocessed_docs]

# Train the LDA model
num_topics = 2  # Specify the desired number of topics
lda_model = LdaModel(bow_corpus, num_topics=num_topics, id2word=dictionary, passes=10)

# Print the discovered topics and their associated keywords
for topic_id in range(num_topics):
    topic_keywords = lda_model.show_topic(topic_id)
    print(f"Topic {topic_id + 1}:")
    for keyword, weight in topic_keywords:
        print(f"- {keyword}: {weight}")
    print()




output:-


Topic 1:
- sky: 0.220
- shining: 0.220
- sun: 0.220
- enjoy: 0.071
- park: 0.071

Topic 2:
- rainy: 0.246
- cozy: 0.246
- days: 0.246
- home: 0.246
- feel: 0.246
