Write a Python program to cluster documents using clustering algorithms


from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

try:
    # Example documents
    documents = [
        "This is the first document.",
        "This document is the second document.",
        "And this is the third one.",
        "Is this the first document?"
    ]

    if not documents:
        raise ValueError("No documents provided.")

    # Create the TF-IDF vectorizer
    vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()

    # Transform the documents into TF-IDF feature vectors
    features = vectorizer.fit_transform(documents)

    # Perform K-means clustering
    k = 2  # Number of clusters
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k)
    kmeans.fit(features)

    # Get the cluster labels
    labels = kmeans.labels_

    # Print the clusters
    for i, document in enumerate(documents):
        cluster_label = labels[i]
        print(f"Document: {document}\t Cluster: {cluster_label}")

except ValueError as e:
    print("Error:", str(e))


output:-

Document: This is the first document.             Cluster: 1
Document: This document is the second document.   Cluster: 1
Document: And this is the third one.              Cluster: 0
Document: Is this the first document?             Cluster: 1
