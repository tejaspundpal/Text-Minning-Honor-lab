Write a Python program to predict if a message is spam or not. 



from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB

# Training data
messages = [
    ("Free money!!! Claim now.", "spam"),
    ("Hey, how are you doing?", "not spam"),
    ("Congratulations! You've won a prize.", "spam"),
    ("Let's meet for coffee.", "not spam")
]

# Create the training dataset
train_texts, train_labels = zip(*messages)

# Vectorize the training texts
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()

try:
    train_features = vectorizer.fit_transform(train_texts)

    # Train the Naive Bayes classifier
    classifier = MultinomialNB()
    classifier.fit(train_features, train_labels)

    # Test message to classify
    test_message = "You've won a free vacation."

    # Vectorize the test message
    test_features = vectorizer.transform([test_message])

    # Predict if the test message is spam or not
    predicted_label = classifier.predict(test_features)[0]

    print("Predicted Label:", predicted_label)

except ValueError:
    print("Unable to classify the message due to empty or invalid input.")




output:-

Predicted Label: spam
