Write a Python program to identify Named Entities (NE) from document corpus. 



import spacy

try:
    # Load the English language model in spaCy
    nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')

    # Example document corpus
    documents = [
        "Apple Inc. was founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne. It is known for its innovative products like the iPhone and MacBook.",
        "Microsoft Corporation, headquartered in Redmond, Washington, was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in 1975. It develops software and hardware products.",
        "Amazon.com, Inc. is a multinational technology company based in Seattle, Washington. It is known for its e-commerce and cloud computing services."
    ]

    # Process each document in the corpus
    for document in documents:
        # Apply NER (Named Entity Recognition) on the document
        doc = nlp(document)

        # Iterate over the identified named entities
        for entity in doc.ents:
            print(f"Entity: {entity.text}\t Label: {entity.label_}")

except OSError as e:
    print("Error:", str(e))
    print("Please make sure to download the required language model using 'python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm'.")


output:-
